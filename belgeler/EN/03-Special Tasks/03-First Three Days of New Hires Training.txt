The first day for new employees (NH) is spent with the video tutorials upstairs with ambassadors. The second day continues with the remaining video tutorials, followed by TC training. Towards the end of the second day, new employees usually go downstairs and receive short practical training in the final waves. On the third day, an ambassador or experienced SA provides practical training for each new employee. The trainers conduct the first three tours themselves, and the new employees only observe. After that, they begin picking independently, under the supervision of the trainer. Qualities always manually assign tours to new employees from the next waves because it would take them a long time to complete the tours while they are in training. New employees pick alone towards the end of the pick period if the trainers approve. Throughout this entire process, Qualities should observe both the new employees and the trainers and report their observations to the supervisors.
*In first weeks new hires will make mistakes. As a quality it is our task to retrain them when they do something not correct. We must be patient and friendly when we are telling people about their mistakes.
