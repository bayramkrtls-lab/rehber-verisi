The process where we process valuable products in different ways and manually deliver them to DSPs on the sideline is called Atlas. On the board, SAs badge placed under the Atlas scan these packages using their Problem Solve in their TC before the pick begins, write the route codes and DSP names on them, and separate them into pick-to-buffer carts for the DSPs to pick up. Once the Atlas tasks are finished, they return to the pick process.
