Sometimes we face many problems at the same time. In situations like these, it makes more sense to prioritize high-priority tasks and get the more important ones done first if we don't have time for others. Here's the order of importance of tasks according to my experience:
Being reachable (carrying a radio, checking chime) -> Cleaning and securing areas have spillage -> Monitoring pick (+Prioritization) -> Missing carts -> Missing bags -> Retraining -> Repack -> Double stage -> Leftover check -> Missing OVs -> Rejected -> FCLM Tracking -> Filling Checklist on Quip.
*The last four tasks can be ignored when time runs out, but only during truly challenging times.
