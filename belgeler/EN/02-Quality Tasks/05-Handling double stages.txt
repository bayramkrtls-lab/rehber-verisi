Double stage happens when two different routes have staged in one staging location. We must find and separate them to avoid DA’s confusion. When SAs come to you by saying that they have a 4th cart for designated staging location; you select “staging location is full” option on Dolphin device and inform SA about to scan any available staging location QR code in sideline and stage their cart on that location. You must write on the carts the informations like route code(z.B. CA_A144), staging location (STG-D17), DSP’s name (OGFR) and the number of carts (4/4). Lastly you must inform Supervisors via Chime(CA_A144 STG-D17 OGFR in sideline ds by skurtulu).
How to detect who made the mistake by staging on already used location?  SCC -> Overview -> Stage -> Type on staging location column the staging location that you discovered the doublestage -> You will see 2 different routes -> Check the staging times -> The route which staged secondly after first routes cart/carts; had the mistake -> Click on that route(Keep the last 3 letters of cart’s id in your mind before you click) -> Check SA’s id on the right side who picked that cart.
*If you're sure there's a double stage at a location but can't find the 4th card, you can check the staging location right behind it. Let's say the 4th card, which should be STG-B01, isn't there; you can first check STG-A01. This is because the QR codes of the two locations are very close, and even though the SA placed their card in STG-A01, they might have scanned the QR code of STG-B01.
**The information from the previous example is also useful when the DAs say they have lost carts. The staging location behind this location is the first place to check for the lost cart.
