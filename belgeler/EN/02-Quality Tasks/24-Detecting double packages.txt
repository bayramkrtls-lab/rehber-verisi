Sometimes, SAs will contact you saying they have extra packages. You can check their picklist in SCC to find out which package is the extra. If you see another package ID on the screen when you scan that package, it means it's a duplicate package. You should remove that package from the cart and leave it in the leftover cart on the sideline without doing anything. If you check the package history in SCC and it says "manifest cancelled," and there's another package ID in the linked ID section in the upper left, it's a duplicate package and needs to be returned.
*It's important not to change the package’s status with your TC that day because when you scan it, it shows the same ID as the other package, so if you give it a receive or other status, DA may experience problems with the other package.
