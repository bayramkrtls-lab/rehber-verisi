We have 96 staging locations and an additional 4 locations in sideline. When pick is too fast; we won’t be having enough staging locations to stage the routes before drivers (DAs) arrive and making carts empty again by loading the items into their vans. To prevent that we must check our empty carts and empty locations stock. If we don’t have enough, we must take people out of pick. 
We must check both of them because sometimes we can have empty cart shortage even though we have many empty staging locations. This happens when we have routes with high volume (high SPR) and because of that we use mostly 3 carts or 4 for 1 route. Normally we use mostly 2 carts for 1 route. We must stop people in this situation also.
*This is also important when monitoring pick, because no matter how fast we want to be, we must make our decision based on available locations and cart conditions.
