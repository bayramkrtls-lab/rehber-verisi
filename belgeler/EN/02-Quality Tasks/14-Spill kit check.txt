During the stow bag replenishment process, we must check all spill kits, as some may need to be refilled. When you need some items to refill them, you can go to Security and ask them to open the HAZMAT cage for you, then you can collect the items and use them to fill the spill kits. You can find the red strips in the bottom drawer at the supervisor desk on the left. You must close all the spill kits with the strip until end of shift.
