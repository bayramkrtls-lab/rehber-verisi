When the routes jump from one wave to another before the previous one is completed, and if we don’t have enough time to complete that previous wave’s routes on time; we must prioritize the routes from the previous wave that are not assigned yet.
*Why routes jump? Because of overcrowding. If routes are mostly in the same aisles; the algorithm  assigns the other routes even their priority is not number 1, to prevent overcrowding in the aisles. 
In those cases; we must go to SCC -> Outbound -> Pick -> Picklist Status -> Select In Progress and Not Assigned -> Select Stage by Time -> Select your target wave
Now you must prioritize the routes by checking their aisles and you must choose first not assigned ones. Go to endpoint symbol on the right at every picklist -> click on it -> prioritize -> choose number 1
**Manually route prioritization means causing intentionally overcrowding because you don’t have any other choice. Because of that we do this only when current wave’s routes are in danger. If you prioritize routes when there is no need; that will create problems.
***When you have so many routes to prioritize, you must avoid prioritizing all at once. That will cause overcrowding and slowing people down more than you wish. Therefore, it's crucial to check the route density in the same aisles within the waves before pick start for each wave. Once we notice this, we can gradually start prioritizing it.
