When DAs claim their vehicles don't have enough space for all packages and want to return some packages or bags, we first need to decide whether to accept the items as "cube out" or "driver rejected." First, we should go to their vehicles, check thoroughly to see if there's enough space, and then verify if the DAs are picking up their packages with the vehicle size they reported to the warehouse that day, using the van size list shared daily by our supervisors. Finally, if the van size matches the list, we can accept the packages as "cube out"; otherwise, we can accept them as "driver rejected."
