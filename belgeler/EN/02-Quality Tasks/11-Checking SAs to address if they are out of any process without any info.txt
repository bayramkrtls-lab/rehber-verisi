We must be aware of SAs during all shift, we must inform our supervisors when we cannot find a SA in the right position. For pickers; we can constantly check SCC -> Associate -> Pick, we must check Picklist currently assigned and Time since last activity section. When Picklist currently assigned is no and Time since last activity is more than 10 minutes, we can inform our supervisors.
