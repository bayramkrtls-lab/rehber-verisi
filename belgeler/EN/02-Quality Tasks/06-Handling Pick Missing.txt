When SAs cannot find the item in their picklist, the packages they mark as missing appear as "Pick Missing" in the Problem Solve-Task section of our TCs when they stage their carts. We click on this alert and the TC screen shows us the ID of the lost item and (sometimes) its Staging location. 
First, go to the aisle and search for the item in the aisle and neighboring aisles. If you can't find it, search for SA's cart. If you still can't find it, go to SCC -> Overview -> Pick -> Clear all filters -> Type the aisle name* (e.g., B36) on the Aisles option -> Click on one by one all the routes to see their staging locations and note the staging locations on a small piece of paper -> Go to the locations and check if they took the lost item -> When you find it, place the item in the correct cart and complete the task.
*If you can't find the package even after following all the steps, select the "Can't find package" option in your TC.
**Sometimes we are having XXL OVs in a cart at sideline because they are too big to fit in the OV racks. Don’t forget to check sideline also.
***Checking near aisles is important because thin OV units can slide under the shelves into the other aisle. Double bins can also be placed in the wrong aisles by Night shift employees.
****On days when pick speed is insufficient, pick missings are not high priority issues, unless they are from a bag. However, since you have to complete the task once you click on a missing item in TC, on busy days, instead of clicking on the warning in TC, you can check the Pick Missing section in SCC->Problem Solve->Exceptions View and differentiate between bag and OV items.
