*If the package is a High Value package, you should stow the package to B2FC container in the PS Cage right after you receive. You can select Stow option on your Dolphin device, and you can select Stow packages, it will show you the B2FC location, place the package nicely in the container and scan the B2FC location.
** On days when pick speed is insufficient, rejected parcels are not high priority issues. DAs have to bring them back anyway. When we face so many problem at the same time, we must prioritize our tasks according their impact levels.
