We must be aware of SAs during all shift, we should inform our supervisors when we cannot find a SA in the right position when an SA is out of the process for 10 minutes we check on them to see if there is ana issue. For pickers; we can constantly check SCC -> Associate -> Pick, we can check "Picklist currently assigned" and "Time since last activity" section. When "Picklist currently assigned" is "no" and "Time since last activity" is more than 10 minutes, we can inform our supervisors.
