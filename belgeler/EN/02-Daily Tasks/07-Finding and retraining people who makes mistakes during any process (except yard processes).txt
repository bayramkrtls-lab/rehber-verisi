When SAs make a mistake (marking an item as missing when it's already in the aisle or on their cart, performing a double stage, leaving their bags or OVs in the aisle despite scanning them to the cart, incorrectly loading items onto their carts, incorrect staging, etc.) as soon as we notice these errors, we need to correct the mistake first, then immediately inform the person responsible for the error and show them the correct procedure.
* Sometimes DAs forget their safety vests or safety shoes, or if they're new to the job, they try to go down the aisles looking for their carts. We need to notice these situations and warn and guide them in an appropriate manner.
