Sometimes SAs or DAs come to you asking a QR code for their bags or carts. 
SAs: Sometimes night shift workers replace damaged bags but don't inform us. In such cases, we need to verify the items inside the bag and generate a QR code for SA to scan for that bag. We can open Google in our browser, type "QR code generator," and create QR codes for bags from any website. SCC -> Overview -> Pick or Stage tab -> Type route code -> Click on it -> Copy the Bag’s ID that you need -> Google -> QR Code Generator -> Choose the Text option -> Paste the bag’s ID.
DAs: Sometimes, after DAs pick up their carts and load their items into their vehicles, they realize they haven't scanned the carts and come to you requesting the cart QR code so they can scan them. Same process with creating QR codes for SAs but instead of bags you must copy cart’s IDs in the picklist.
