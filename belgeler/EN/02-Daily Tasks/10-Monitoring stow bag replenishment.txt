Only as a POC, you can make changes on the staffing board about stow bag replenishment. If you think some Clusters needs more people than others; you can replace SAs badges to plan it more effectively. 
After the pick-and-stage is complete, we need to personally check that the SAs are in the correct position for stow bag replenishment. Since we cannot digitally monitor the performance of the SAs during this process, we must constantly check all of them ourselves, moving around continuously.
When all empty bags are physically placed in the racks, SAs can start marrying(scanning) the bags to the locations. SCC -> Sort -> Stow -> Stow Breakdown -> Missing(Fehlt) section must be 0 for all aisles.
When you see 1; click on the aisle, it will show you all the locations in the aisle. Check the Open(Offen) section, all will be 1 except only one location, one location will be 0. Send someone to check and marry a bag to that location if it is possible. If QR code is damaged or missing for that location you must create a new QR code.
