When a damaged package is identified, we must go to the yard quality for assistance. First, we obtain an empty bag of the same color. Then, we lay out brown paper on the table to the right. Next, wearing gloves, we take the damaged packages one by one, open them on the brown paper-covered table, connect the TC to the printer, scan the package with our TC, and print a new label by selecting Package Problem -> Damage Label -> Print Label. If the damaged package's status is "in transit," we receive it; otherwise, we select Package Problem -> Damage package and follow the steps. Once all packages have been transferred to a new bag, we give it to the DA or place it in the cart at the staging location.
